# Rust Code Samples

This repository contains various Rust code samples covering different topics. Each section represents a specific Rust program showcasing different concepts and functionalities.

## Table of Contents

1. [Hello](#hello)
2. [Conditional Control Flow](#condition-controlflow)
3. [Area of Shapes](#area_of_shapes)
4. [Calculator](#calculator)
5. [Serde JSON Task](#serde-json-task)
6. [Table Task](#table-task)

## Hello

The `hello` program is a basic Rust application that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. It serves as an introductory example for those new to Rust programming.

## Conditional Control Flow

In the `condition_controlflow` section, you'll find Rust code demonstrating conditional statements and control flow mechanisms, including if-else constructs. This helps illustrate how Rust handles decision-making in code.

## Area of Shapes

The `area_of_shapes` program is designed to calculate the areas of different shapes, such as rectangles, squares, and circles. The calculations are based on user input, making it an interactive example for practicing Rust programming.

## Calculator

The `calculator` program is a Rust implementation of a basic calculator. It performs essential arithmetic operations and showcases the use of modules and sub-modules to organize code efficiently.

## Serde JSON Task

The `serde_json_task` is a Rust program handling JSON serialization and deserialization using the Serde library. It demonstrates how to work with JSON data in Rust.

## Table Task
The `table_task` and `table_task2` is a Rust program to generate a table using stuctures of Cell,Row and Table.Then generating json file of that data.
## Usage

Clone the repository and run each Rust program separately using the following commands:

```bash
cargo run --bin hello
cargo run --bin condition_controlflow
cargo run --bin area_of_shapes
cargo run --bin calculator
cargo run --bin serde_json_task
cargo run --bin table_task
cargo run --bin table_task2
